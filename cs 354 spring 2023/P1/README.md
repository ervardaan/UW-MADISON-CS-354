# Technical Objectives of the Assignment
In completing "A Fortune to Get You Started" assignment, students will learn several technical objectives:

- Understanding the Caesar Cipher: Students will get a practical understanding of how the Caesar cipher works, a fundamental cryptographic method where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
- C Programming Basics: Students will modify and work with C source code, providing an opportunity to understand basic programming constructs and syntax in C.
- Linux Command Line Proficiency: Students will use the Linux command line to manage their project files and directories, which is a crucial skill for software development, especially in environments that rely heavily on Unix/Linux systems.
- Text Editing in Linux: Students will use Linux text editors (like vim, emacs, nano) to edit code, learning essential commands and shortcuts that enhance programming efficiency.
- Software Build Process: Through compiling, linking, and assembling steps, students will learn how source code is transformed into an executable program.
- Debugging and Output Analysis: Students will inspect different intermediate files to understand errors and the machine-level representation of their programs.
- File Management and Data Manipulation: Students will practice managing files within the Linux environment and manipulate data to decode messages.
- List of Tasks Students Will Complete
## Here is the detailed list of tasks that students will complete as part of the assignment:

- Connect to a CS Linux Machine: Remotely log in to a university-provided Linux machine to begin their work.
- Directory Navigation and Setup: Use Linux commands to navigate to the appropriate directory, create directories, and set up their working environment.
- Retrieve and Modify the Source File: Download the provided decode.c source file and add a file header comment as specified in the guidelines.
- Preprocess the Source Code: Use the GCC compiler to preprocess the C source code and store its result.
- Compile the Preprocessed Code: Compile the preprocessed source code to generate assembly code, understanding the transition from high-level to low-level code.
- Assemble the Compilation Output: Convert the assembly code into an object file (machine code in a non-executable format).
- Link Object Files: Combine the object file with system libraries to create an executable file.
- Execute the Program: Run the executable to decode the encrypted message using the Caesar cipher technique.
- Output Management: Save the decoded output to a file, ensuring it matches the expected format for grading.
- Submission of Project Files: Compile all relevant files (source code, intermediate files, executable, and output text) and submit them on the course's Canvas page, adhering to specific submission guidelines.
- These tasks are designed to not only provide students with a thorough understanding of the Caesar cipher but also give them hands-on experience in various aspects of software development, from writing and editing code to building and running applications in a Linux environment.
